        <h1>Leadership is an Act of Service, Not a Title</h1>
        <p>I have always been described as someone with a “type A” personality. As such, I tend to find myself in some leadership role. From my high school days of project-based learning to the classes of my final college semester, I have always found myself managing group projects. In my computing capstone, CSCE 490 and CSCE 492, I took to getting everyone organized, constructing the talking points for each meeting, and making sure that everyone’s voice was heard. I was not assigned this role by anyone. I took the initiative. In the fall semester of 2024, I organized the meetings for my Information Security Principles course, CSCE 522, where our group developed automated filtering for network analysis. In CSCE 247, Software Engineering, I organized meetings and helped distribute work for our Learning Management System project. The code for that project can be found in the sidebar. As my time at USC has gone by, I have had time to reflect on how I carry myself professionally. That “type A” attitude I carried during my time in high school did not serve me well in college. In the beginning, I would take on extra work if I was worried about a deadline or constantly check over my peers’ work to ensure the project requirements were met. The way I work with my peers as a leader has evolved with each group project, leadership workshop, and year as a student organization leader.</p>
        <p> In the Capstone Scholars Leadership Program, we covered five practices of exemplary leadership. Leaders model the way by “setting the standard” and showing their values through their actions. They inspire a shared vision by envisioning a better future, not just for themselves but for others. They challenge the process by always striving to be better and being willing to adapt, change, and grow. They enable others to act by building others up rather than tearing them down. Finally, leaders encourage the heart by recognizing the accomplishments of others and celebrating the achievements of the individuals in their team. My former mentor for Pride of Capstone was the instructor for the CSLP class I took. She recommended that I take the class, and I am thankful for that. I was a freshman and a leader in a student organization that was not even official yet. I had leadership positions in high school and went to plenty of leadership clinics, but this was the first time I was helping build something from the ground up with a team of people I barely knew. I had a horrible tendency to take all the work for myself out of distrust of my team members. At the end of the semester, we listened to everyone’s Campus Impact Plan, our final project was a detailed action plan to bring change to USC. My impact plan (hyperlink to Impact Plan Poster PDF) was the student organization I would continue to serve until graduation, Pride of Capstone. After I presented, I calmed my nerves to listen closely to the other projects. One was about expanding the Gamecock Pantry, some were about making campus more environmentally friendly, and there were plenty of potential solutions to fix parking on campus. The plans were detailed and well thought out, and many of my classmates went on to fulfill their action plans. Despite consciously listening to my classmates, something in the back of my head underestimated them and the work they could accomplish. I devalued them without realizing. My ego was checked that day, I took the time to reflect on why I felt that way. Working with my classmates in the CSLP helped teach me that I could rely on others. Leadership is not about having control over every little detail. It is about guiding others to the best versions of themselves while going through consistent self-reflection. My level of trust in my peers improved with each new project I worked on, to the point where I felt confident in the abilities of myself and my teammates. There was, however, a piece of the puzzle still missing.</p>
        <p>When I joined the Carolina Band, I went in with full intentions of being in leadership. I was section leader, drum major, woodwind sergeant, and loading crew in my high school band. I “did it all” and I wanted college to be no different. I applied for everything I could after my first year: Section leader, Drum Major, and everything in between. I did not make any of them. I applied again after my sophomore year, and then my junior year. I stumbled my way through interviews, went through applications with minimal effort, and was overall unprepared for everything that was thrown at me. It took me until after my failed senior staff interview that I realized that I was after a title. I applied because I felt like I had to. In the background, I was battling both physical and mental health issues while attempting to balance an academically heavy major, managing a student organization, and working 25 hours a week. I was not equipped to deal with any additional responsibility. I decided that my senior year was going to be for me to enjoy my final year of marching band. Despite not having any official authority, I still went and introduced myself to new members, talked with them about their goals and interests, and answered any questions they had about band. I encouraged those around me through the pregame test, every rep of basics, every pep rally, every football game. At the start, I did it just so it would look better when I applied for leadership, but as I got older, I realized I genuinely enjoyed making connections with people. I was interested in their stories and what they would accomplish both inside and outside of the band. </p>
        <p>Toward the end of our 2024 season, the Carolina Band traveled to New York City to perform in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. While that performance was impactful, I still think about the conversations I had with my fellow band members during the trip. I went to the McDonalds in Times Square with members of my section. As we were crossing the street, one of my section leaders, who was a year behind me, told me that she would miss me when I graduated. The statement caught me completely off guard. She sensed my confusion and elaborated. “I felt like I didn’t have a place here in band when I first joined,” she said, “but you were always quick to make sure I was included. It encouraged me to stay and become a section leader. You didn’t judge me like a lot of the others did.” I thanked her for her kind words, but I still could not process what she told me. After my roommates and I went back to our hotel room, I talked with them about the interaction and my confusion. It turned out that they too had their own stories about how I inspired them in some way. Anecdotes about how I encouraged them in some way. I had no clue about the impact that I had on members of the band. I had no title and no connection with the staff in a band 375 members strong. As far as I was concerned, I was nobody. I took the time to help and get to know everyone I could, and that impacted them more than a title in the handbook.</p>
        <p>In my CSLP workbook, I defined leadership as: </p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <p>A tool to inspire and direct people to be the best version of themselves. It has no age, no gender, no color. Anyone with the proper determination and skillset can be a leader. Leadership requires sacrifices and challenges that one is willing to go through to make change and motivate the people around them. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This was the foundation of how I saw a leader, but it was not until I got hands-on experience in college that I truly understood. I spoke the words and went through the motions, but I did not internalize the core values of leadership until I could not hold the word “leader” in my hands. As I was reflecting on this insight, I thought of a scene in the movie Spiderman: Homecoming. In the scene, Tony Stark tells Peter Parker “If you’re nothing without this suit, then you shouldn’t have it.” That holds true for leadership titles as well. It is not about the title; it is the person behind the title that matters. I had to learn to truly respect my peers regardless of their role and learn what it was like to be a leader, even if I did not hold the title of one. </p>
