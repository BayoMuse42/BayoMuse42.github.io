              <p>
                My name is Rhaynie Bongiorno, a soon-to-be graduate from the University of South Carolina. Currently, I am pursuing my bachelor's of science in Computer Information Systems, with a minor in Business Information Management, a concentration in Cyber Security, and with a Leadership Distinction in Professional and Civic Engagement.  I left my small hometown of Walterboro, South Carolina for Columbia in hopes of experiencing the rich college culture USC had to offer, and I was not disappointed. Through my time at the University of South Carolina, I have had the opportunity to work with amazing people and create new experiences.  <br><br>
    
            When I came to USC, I already had my career path in mind. My sights were set on the world of Cyber Security.  I had done projects in high school such as building virtual machines to observe malware in a sandboxed environment. USC provided me with opportunities within the classroom to expand my computing knowledge. I met with like-minded students and built connections while building applications. While searching for a part-time job, I had the opportunity to work with the University’s Division of Information Technology. I was able to apply my years of self-taught computing knowledge and my classwork to real work experience. I started as a service technician, answering customers' questions over the phone and helping those who brought their devices in-person. I later joined forces with the University Information Security Office and was thrown into the security analyst role for the first time. I was on the front lines of defending the university from cyber threats, learning from experienced analysts and engineers along the way. What started to keep the lights on reignited my passion for helping people behind the screen. My within and beyond the classroom experiences encouraged me to excel in my classes and provided me with valuable career experience. <br><br>
    
            The main aspect that drew me to USC was the campus culture. In high school, I was heavily involved in my school’s marching band. I was originally not planning to join the Carolina Band, but I decided to pick up my saxophone for at least another year. Four years and a performance at the biggest national parade in the United States later, I am honored that I was able to call myself a member of the Mighty Sound of the Southeast. The Carolina Band gave me opportunities to travel, perform, and create lifelong friendships. The hot summer days of band camp to the exciting Saturdays at Williams-Brice Stadium, performing with this group allowed me to experience the spirit and pride that comes with being a Gamecock.  <br><br>
    
            I was also able to give back to my community by serving as a founding member and communications chair for the Pride of Capstone LGBTQ+ affinity organization. As someone from a small town that did not have support, I was eager to engage with the LGBTQ+ community in Columbia. I was invited to become a member of leadership for an affinity organization for the Capstone Scholars program, and I jumped at the opportunity. Through Pride of Capstone, I have been able to experience queer culture and help others learn about the resources USC and Columbia has to offer to the queer community. I got to work with amazing student organizations such as IRIS and OStem and participate in community events such as Carolina Pride. <br><br>
    
            My ePortfolio will take you through the three key insights I am taking away from my time here at Carolina. It will also highlight the professional project that encompasses my growth as a security professional. As I wrap up an amazing four years, join me as I reflect on how USC shaped my personal and professional growth.
