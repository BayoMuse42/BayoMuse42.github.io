                    Our users are having trouble keeping track of everything they have going on in their lives; from <br>
                    classes, to work, to personal obligations. Physical planners take up space and can be easily <br>
                    forgotten, and many digital alternatives don’t have everything our users need. Our solution <br>
                    should be to develop an all-in-one solution that will notify students of tasks and allow students <br>
                     to modify it to their needs. <br>
