        <h1>Cybersecurity: A Fast-paced Field that is Constantly Growing and Changing</h1>
        <p>I found my passion for computing at an early age. I put together my first computer before I finished my first Lego set. By middle school, I learned how to create a virtual computer and watch viruses in real-time without harming my machine. I read news stories from experts and personal anecdotes of malware victims while watching the damage of cybercrime in real-time. By the time I graduated high school, and it was time for me to choose my degree path, I knew exactly what I wanted to do. I wanted to enter the world of cyber security. As the world grows increasingly digital, the impact of cybercrime grows. In 2020, “$4 billion was lost to cybercrime in the United States” according to an <a href="https://www.state.gov/cybercrime">FBI estimate.</a> My passion for computers and my passion for helping others combined into a challenging yet rewarding career path. The greatest challenge is keeping pace with the ever-evolving cyber threats.</p>
        <p>In CSCE 522, Information Security Principles, we talked about foundational security concepts and frameworks. The foundation of all security, whether physical or cyber, relies on the CIA Triad. The CIA Triad stands for confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Confidentiality means that only the people authorized to have access to a resource. Movies often show Governments having something as “top secret,” and those security measures are made to protect confidentiality. Integrity means that the resource is unchanged from what is expected. In terms of cyber security, making sure that the file you download is the file you want and not a virus is an example of protecting integrity. Finally, availability means that the resource should be available to those who need to use it. An example of availability is being able to access your social media account after you log in.</p>
        <p>The world of security revolves around these three core concepts. Someone who intends to do harm with computers, known as a threat actor, looks to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer systems. Security professionals are always looking to stay one step ahead of threat actors. In Information Security Principles, we formed groups. Our project was to develop a security “proof of concept” that would aid cybersecurity professionals in the fight against threat actors. My group presented filters and automation solutions for Wireshark, a tool that allows security analysts to see how information is traveling over the internet. The presentation and final report for that project can be found in the sidebar. While the class was insightful on security issues, my exposure to real-world threats started a year prior.</p>
        <p>In September of 2023, I moved from my job as a Service Desk Technician in USC’s Division of Information Technology to the University’s Information Security Office. I worked in both teams over that Summer and was amazed by the work being done. By the end of the Summer, I was collaborating with the full-time employees handling alerts, and working on security incidents. I saw the CIA triad in action as my team protected the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of university assets. Once I was taken on as an intern properly, I was tasked with overhauling how the UISO managed phishing detection and incident response. Phishing is a manipulation tactic used to get personal information. This information can then be sold, published publicly, or used to gain access to a system. Working with phishing cases was an eye-opening way for me to watch how the techniques change over time. Scammers would, for example, impersonate University officials, use fake login sites that looked like the University’s, or pretend to be Microsoft support. Some threat actors would use QR codes to try to compromise users’ phones or mask their malicious links as safe ones. Every time a new technique showed up, our team had to adapt our remediation strategy.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, my job was to develop an automation tool that would help detect potential phishing campaigns. Along with my normal analyst responsibilities, I have developed and maintained a program known as “Phishing Bot.” This tool, built with the block-code automation platform Power Automate and the programming language Python (<a href=#AppendixA>see Appendix A</a>), analyses the phishing emails reported on campus and notifies our analysts if certain criteria are met (<a href=#AppendixB>see Appendix B</a>). For example, if an email with a specific subject was seen more than five times, or an email was impersonating the president of USC, analysts would be notified. My tool has cut the response time to phishing incidents significantly and freed time for our analysts to help adapt our defense strategy. I had a hands-on opportunity to have an impact on our university’s security and aid in the never-ending struggle of cyber defense.</p>
        <p>Perfect security is not achievable. As technology grows and changes, new ways to exploit the imperfections of both machines and the people who make them are found. It is up to security professionals to stay current to make the digital landscape a safer place. In the classroom and in the workplace, I found my love for this fast-paced field that is forever growing.</p>
