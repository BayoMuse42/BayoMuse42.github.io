        <h1>Communication is the Key to Understanding</h1>
        <p>Before coming to college, my communication skills needed work. Meeting new people terrified me. Presentations peaked my anxiety higher than anything else. However, through my time at USC, I found a love for both meeting new people and presenting topics I am passionate about. Moving away from home and living with people I did not know gave me the fresh start I always wanted, but it also meant I had to make new connections. I could only count the number of people who attended USC from my high school on one hand. I also knew that as my college career continued, I would have to find internships and work on my professional network. I would need to take the technical knowledge I had gained from my classes and present it in a way that the layperson could understand. To know if I truly understood my craft, I had to be able to communicate its concepts.</p>
        <p>When I entered the classroom for ENGL 462, Technical Writing, I did not have a good understanding of what technical writing was. I knew it had something to do with writing official documents, but not much else. My professor described the concept of technical writing as writing specialized information in a clear and accessible manner. She gave the example of writing an instruction manual: A document that has simple, clear language that is easy to understand. Our assignments consisted of writing different types of technical documents. Some examples include memos, definitions, steps to a process, and full block letters. Our final assignment was a response to a Request for Proposal (RFP) document. An RFP is a request a company sends out to potential vendors for a service. An RFP response is a document from a prospective vendor that contains their qualifications, methods, timeline, and project budget. For my RFP response, I created a proposal for a Learning Management System, like Blackboard, based on my team’s work in a previous class, CSCE 247 (Software Engineering).  I had to break down concepts such as the SCRUM development framework, Sprint backlogs, and the process of debugging a program. Explaining computer science concepts to those who are more business-minded is commonplace in the industry I intend to enter. This assignment prepared me for the technical documentation I would have to work with in my career.</p>
        <p>The first Summer I started working with the University’s Information Security Office was eventful. Before the changes to the phishing automation <a href="Key_Insight2.html">(see Key Insight #2)</a> were put in place, our team had to look for phishing campaigns manually. We had several instances of user accounts being taken over by hostile actors because of fake university emails. I was part of the team that had to respond to the incident and help with the recovery process. Part of that recovery process is writing an incident report that details what happened, why it happened, and how similar incidents can be prevented in the future. The technical writing skills I had gained from class had translated well to a real-world scenario. With supervision from one of the senior analysts and the help of another intern, we wrote a report detailing the events that led to the accounts being compromised. This report is meant to be seen by the Chief Information Security Officer and the Chief Information Officer of the university and could be sent to the President if he requested it. A section of the incident response report detailed how my phishing automation detection code worked. While the CISO and CIO are technical people, they are far removed from their days of technical work. This requires me to break down the technical aspects of my code and what role it plays in a business context.</p>
        <p>While technical writing is an integral part of my work, the communication skills gained from the practice can translate to helping the community. Nothing seems to be more complicated than identity. I came to USC from a small town that was not understanding of its LGBTQ+ residents. During my first semester, I started going to different LGBTQ+ organization meetings, learning about the amazing opportunities and resources for LGBTQ+ students on campus. While the resources were plentiful, I had to hunt them down. This experience is what I kept in mind when I was asked to form Pride of Capstone in the Spring of 2022. The Capstone Scholars program focuses on the freshman and sophomore classes. Many LGBTQ+ students may not know about the resources offered at USC before arriving on campus. There are also a lot of terms and jargon within the LGBTQ+ community that may be difficult for a newcomer or outsider to understand. One of my goals with the Pride of Capstone organization was to bring awareness to the resources available and educate on why we need them. In my sophomore year, I was invited to speak at a mental health event in Russell House. Reconnect and Restore was a mental health summit hosted by the university’s student health services. I worked with another student to break down the resources that the university offers for LGBTQ+ students while talking about specifics of how being queer can affect one’s mental health. I did not know it at the time, but I was practicing the concepts of technical writing through my presentation. Even though I was speaking instead of writing a document, I still had to communicate in a clear, concise way. With the advantage of being in-person to answer questions, the other speaker and I were able to share information about valuable resources that help our student community.</p>
        <p>Clear, effective communication is the key to successful relationships. Whether they be personal or professional, short or long term, understanding one another starts with a conversation. The opportunities I have had to grow my skillset at USC have shaped the way I communicate with others. I slowly overcame that anxiety and now take every opportunity I am given to share my passions. This shift is all thanks to the skills I gained studying, working, and presenting throughout my four-year college career. </p>
